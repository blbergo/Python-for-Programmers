2. Write a program that helps a person decide whether to buy a hybrid car. Your
program's inputs should be:
- The cost of a new car
- The estimated miles driven per year
- The estimated gas price
- The efficiency in miles per gallon
- The estimated resale value after five years

Compute the total cost of owning the car for five years. (For simplicity, we will not
take the cost of financing into account.) Obtain realistic prices for a new and used
hybrid and a comparable car from the Web. Run your program twice, using todayâ€™s
gas price and 15,000 miles per year.
